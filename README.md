# StarCitizenRosterToGoogleSheet
This is a project I made for my Star Citizen organization to have our members in a google sheet. 

There are 2 scripts to this, the build roster one is a script I used to initalize the google sheet with all our members. (this took a while) 
The update roster is a script I have running on a google cloud service VM on a linux console running it every 30 minutes.

Not inlcuded in is a JSON file with information used to acess a bot account to edit the google sheet.

For more information or the ability to contact me you can find everything over at my portfolio: https://AaronBlok.dev/
